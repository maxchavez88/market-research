Market Analysis and Insights

Global Solar Thermal Collector Market

Solar thermal collector market is expected to gain market growth in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. Data Bridge Market Research analyses the solar thermal collector market to account to USD 81.76 billion growing at a CAGR of 13.38% in the above-mentioned forecast period. Rising concern regarding depletion of natural resources has been directly impacting the growth of solar thermal collector market.

Solar thermal collector is used to heat water and air. Active solar systems have thermal collectors used to absorb heat energy, supplied by the sun, water heaters and space temperatures. Roof solar panels (collectors) are the main source of heat generation, used in conjunction with a boiler, collector or immersion heater. The solar collector uses the sun's rays to heat the transfer fluid, which is usually a mixture of water and glycol. Glycol acts as an anti-freeze and prevents water from freezing. In concentrated solar power plants, other complex types of solar thermal collectors are used to generate electricity.

Development of new technologies to increase the efficiency of the product is a main driver for solar thermal collector market. Growing demand for power and the depleting fossil fuels have triggered the need to find alternatives to fossil fuels for power generation which is also a driver for the solar thermal collector market. Due to an increase in the construction sector and high electricity rates is also an opportunity for the growth of solar thermal collector market.

Lack of sunlight in adequate quantity in several nations and high installation cost is a challenge for solar thermal collector market. However, less awareness among consumers regarding the benefits of making use of solar energy in underdeveloped and developing economies is a restraint in growth of solar thermal collector market during the forecast period of 2021-2028.

In November 2019, Heliogen, announced its launch commercially concentrated solar energy to exceed temperatures greater than 1,000 degrees Celsius. At that temperature, Heliogen can replace the use of fossil fuels in critical industrial processes, including the production of cement, steel, and petrochemicals, dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from these activities. This singular scientific achievement was accomplished at Heliogen’s commercial facility in Lancaster, California. Heliogen’s mission is to create the world’s first technology that can commercially replace fossil fuels with carbon-free, ultra-high temperature heat from the sun and to transform sunlight into fuels at scale taking a major step towards solving climate change.
